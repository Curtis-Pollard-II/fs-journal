# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I am trying to find joy in the small amount of indipendence gained this week. I really wish I could debug better. I think that would give me the most confidence boost. Nonetheless, I felt successful this week more than the last. I think the MVC model is starting to stick a little more and I am able to track where the code is going more and more.
