# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

The full stack app was a really good experience. The time needed to complete the project was pretty significant and the fact that we only had monday with no checkpoint has made me feel like I have been going nonstop. Regardless, the completion of the checkpoint was really satisfying. I am looking forward to next week being able to do another full stack app but with less time pressure and more teamwork. Hopefully this will allow for more learning to stick.
