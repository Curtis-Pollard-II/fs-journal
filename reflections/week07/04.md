## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Last week during partner programing we did a good job of defining roles before we started and being really vocal. That meant we both would frequently ask each other what was happening in a specific line of code or try and explain it.

2. What went well this week?

This week was actually our first full stack app, which we did inducidually, I think there was a change recently in the curriculum which would explain these partner questions. I was feeling not prepared for the backend part of the project but the testing helped. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at how much problem solving I was able to do on my own before asking for help. Independence always feels good.

3. What would you do differently?

My usual answer to these questions after a checkpoint is to say styling. There just isn't the amount of time to fiddle around while styling, which I feel like is necessary to gain styling experience.
