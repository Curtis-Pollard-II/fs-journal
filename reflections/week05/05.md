# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week was the first where my drive to push myself after hour slowed down. There were some variables outside of the program that contributed to this lack of drive. This weekend has allowed me to reflect on the week and give myself some new goals that will hopefully get me back on track.
