## Questions

Designating a certain amount of time for completing a task.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

2-minute rule with emails
strategic quitting
Know your golden hour (figure out mine)



3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

In a earlier checkpoint I got transfixed on an issue that I couldn't seem to solve. Instead of walking away or coming back to it, I grinded until my mind got mushy. This effected my later coding performance.
