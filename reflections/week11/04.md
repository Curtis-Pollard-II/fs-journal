## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

The course has been a great success. Nothing is perfect But all the foundation pieces are in place. My biggest concern throughout the course was the loss of Britney. A big part of the reason I joined the course was the fact that there was some support for finding a job in place. Also, I think it is important to simplify lecture for two reasons. One, it makes reference code easier to follow later. Two, it takes less time away from lab.

I have loved the culture here at codeworks. There is a great environment for learning.
