# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Successful first week. The pace was a little fast, but within my capabilites. Some lingering questions include: When do you apply class to parent and when do you apply to a child? Overall, I am feeling good about where I am at. I created some solid learning routines and habits the first week and hope to replicate in weeks to come. I am a little concerned with my speed. I am worried there will be a more complex future checkpoint that requires lots of code. My speed will hopefully increase by then.
