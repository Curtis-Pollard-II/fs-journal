## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

They add styles to selectors. Hover or focus maybe...

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

when there are multiple rules targeting the same element. Not sure how that would help my brain. I like things to line up nice and neat...

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

it overrides the existing code priority making debugging a little bit more tricky. It might be harder to trace a problem back to its origin.
