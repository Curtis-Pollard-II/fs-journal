## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

outline, structure, or skeleton of a webpage

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

-Keep the user focused
-Clarify and define website (useful when working with a client)
-Cheap and easy to make


3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, I bet programmers would do a wire-frame whether or not a client asked for on, because it helps them visualize what they are creating. Also, it gives client and yourself something to be accountable for later at completion.
