## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

It is organization tool for tracking changes made to a project or seeing what teammates have done. Keeps everyone on the same page. Also, allows you to go back to older versions of the project if needed.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

I am thinking this would be helpful when multiple people are working on a project and want to try some different strategies. Branching out allows them to test the strategies and later merge if needed.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a local repository and GitHub is remote repository that is open for others to see and work on.
