## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Using fewer borders and instead wisely using space to create the desired separation.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

font weight over font size, primary (dark) secondary (grey) ancillary (lighter grey), font weight 400-700, No grey on colorful background = reduce opacity of white text or pick a better color, use fewer borders = 1. use a box shadow 2. use different background color 3. simply give it more space, use accent colors

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think good design makes people focus on the content and not get distracted. Conversely poor design gets people distracted from their original intent of being on the website, which is bad. design can lead peoples eyes to the right things.
