# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

THis week was very complex. I am not feeling as confident with my progress as I did in weeks past. There are some basic principles that I do understand, but I was really reliant on slacked out examples from the week to make progress on my checkpoint. I need to put in more time practicing next week. The more practice I get the more confident I feel. It doesn't necessarily matter the amount of new content or complexity, my confidence is dictated on the about of successful lab sessions I have.
