## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

allows code from different files to be stored elsewhere. The problem that it solves is organization.

2. How does export differ from export default?

export differs because it holds more information about each variable...I think. and the default only exports the object as a whole...

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

code can be separated in to smaller files that are easier to access and to stay organized.
