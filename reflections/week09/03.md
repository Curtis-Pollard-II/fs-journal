## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is a work around created to prevent images from loading one after the other. It uses the HTTP connection to deliver images embedded directly into the html. THis prevents messaging through the browser for the files.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

It increases the file size by more than 25%. It is an outdated practice. There are much more efficient ways.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Browsers cache images locally on page load. But it can not do this with Base64. This ends up putting a bunch of stress on the server and the bandwidth.
