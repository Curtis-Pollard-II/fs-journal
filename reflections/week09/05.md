## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


CapStones have come and gone. It was a really great experience. Couple of thoughts:

1) The API you choose is important. We didn't fully understand how and what to look for in an API's attributes when selecting. As a result we Got a very LARGE database with little built in parameters to draw specific data. This messed with our functionality. 

2) I am proud of taking on some of the fearful concepts in our project. Getting filters to work and setting up the many to many relationships of users liking content was daunting. I didn't succeed, which is to be expected. But I am glad I pushed myself to understand what the task was and even to ask the right questions to come to a solution with the help of many more experienced TA's Teachers, and Developers.
