## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using Vue, JavaScript, An API

2. What went well so far?

We nailed down our idea, we just need to come up with the implimintation plan.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I don't know if there is anything different we could have done. We maybe needed to acknowledge the fact that we are all new at this and will fail in our code, but also fail planning and working in a team. And thats all good! That is how you learn.
