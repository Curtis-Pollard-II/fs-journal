# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


The biggest thing troubling me during JavaScript week is just the order and sytax of variables and variable names. connecting the dots between what each varible meaning or value is, an how to access it in other parts of the code. I am also finding that I am a little more drawn to the visual design of a DOM more so then the functionality of it. I am wanting to learn more about CSS and all the avaliable options of styling.
