# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

THis was a tought week. I felt a rush of addreniline to get a job. SO I pushed a lot of my time and effort into doing that at the expense of my learning. Both are good choices but I really need to alocate the right amount of time to my learning in order to prevent any future bumps in the road.
