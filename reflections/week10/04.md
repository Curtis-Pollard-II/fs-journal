## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Strongly typed constants (enum of one tkype may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type)
-- Used in cases of more maintaionable code

2. How can you modify an Enum?

create and instance of an enum type and then add cases to that type...THis didn't make a lot of sense to me...

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not yet, but I image using them to convert an int into an enum.
