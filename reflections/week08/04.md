## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - test individual units of code in isolation
Component Testing - give users the ability to see whats happening in the DOM
End-To-End (E2E) Testing - test what happens when users actually use the application

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

end to end seems to be the most useful because it brings together all the other parts to make sure everything is commumicating and operating as planed.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Unit testing, Seems like this test could be skipped the more experience you had as a developer. But it is essential for new developers.
