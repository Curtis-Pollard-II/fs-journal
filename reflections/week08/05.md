# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This has been an interesting week. The first time coding in a group. Lots of things to note and learn from. First, I expected the group to be coding a lot more then we actually are. This isn't a bad thing. I think we are being really intentional about how we spend our time. We are trying to avoid the pitfalls of coding first/fixing later. It is tough knowing what to prioritize. Our communication as a group has been solid thus far. I am trying to be the scrum master and lead a stand up every morning. THankfully our group communication has been really open thus far making stand up easy to facilitate. I do feel like we are behind. But with an extra push we should be able to meet our deadline by weeks end.
