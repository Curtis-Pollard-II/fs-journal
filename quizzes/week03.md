its a way to access and object that is in the appState (which means it has more protection from a user trying to manipulate)
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It seems like it really helps with the encapsulation. Also, its just a way to keep your code more organized

```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

it handles all items that are being changed by the user.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
